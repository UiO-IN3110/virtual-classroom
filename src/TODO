TODO:

- Generate stats: commits, comments, attendence ect.
- Make collaboration work with groups of one.
- Change to OAuth(?)
- Check if there is an Attendance repository in the classrom, if not create one. Or
  make a script that pushes todays group list.
- Need a more robust way of handling special characters in student.py
- Create standard filepaths in default_parameters (for collecting 
  feedbacks and repos)
- Change to google forms for feedbacks on the projects instead of pushing a
  file ( will fix a lot of bugs with text formats)
- Make the program into a module
- Make it Python 3 / python 2 compatible
- Add precommit hooks for codestyle
- Add support for collaboration on a project
- Create tests
- Do a general profiling of the program

Potential speed up:
- Use s = request.Session() and set s.auth = auth, and then use s.put, s.get and
  so on, is this faster?
