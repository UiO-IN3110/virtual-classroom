Hi %(name)s!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the fourth mandatory group session we have registered that you have 
attended and passed two sessions out of four so far. Hence
you are lacking one session to pass. 

There are only one session left (perhaps two), so make sure that you have 
enough sessions passed before the end of the semester. The last group
session(s) will have an extensive overlap with the exam, so it is
strongly recommended to participate.

Note: This is done automatically and is based on the name of the files in your
repository. So if the information above is incorrect, please reply this email.
