Hi %(name)s!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Tuesday, November 4th, the fourth mandatory group session will take place. 
We have registered that you have not attended nor passed any of the previous 
sessions. As we mentioned at the beginning og the course, you have to have 
three out of five in order to pass. However if you show up on Tuesday I am 
positive we can find a solution. Therefore it is very important that you 
show up on Tuesday!

There are only two sessions left including the one on Tuesday.
