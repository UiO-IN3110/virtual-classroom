Hi %(name)s!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Tuesday, November 4th, the fourth mandatory group session will take place. We have 
registered that you have attended and passed only one session out of three so far. Hence 
you are missing two. It is therefore very important that you show up on Tuesday!

There are only two sessions left including the one on Tuesday.
