Report (if any)
===============

- Rank the overall quality of the report

Excellent/ok/not sufficient


- Is the report easy to read?


- Give examples on parts that are difficult to understand (if any)


- Find one strength of the report


- Fine one weakness of the report


- Is the mathematics done correctly?


- Does the report coincide with the implementation? If not, please point out the parts that mismatch.


- Is it clear how the results were obtained?

- List the mathematical parts that are not answered.


Testing
=======

- Rank the overall quality of the tests

Excellent/ok/not sufficient

- Do all tests work?


- Are all tests implemented?


- Is it possible to run tests with py.test or nosetests?



Programming (this should be split into one for each exercise)
==============================================================

- Rank the overall quality of the programming

Excellent/ok/not sufficient


Is it easy to read the program? More specifically,

- Is there a 4 space indentation?


- Are there too long lines?


- Are there enough comments?


- Are the variable names sensible or in correspondance with the
  mathematical notation?


- Are there docstrings?


- Is whitespace used correctly, like space after comma, etc.?

- Are there some odd ways of doing things in the program? That is,
  do you have an suggestion for a simpler implementation?


- Can you find unnecessarily inefficient parts of the program?


- Are there parts of the program that are hard to understand?


- Do you find overuse of classes or not sufficient use of functions (or
  classes)?


- List the programming parts that are not answered.


General
=======

- Rank the overall quality of the project


- Is there a list over how to run each program?


- Are all the questions answered?


- If the assignment is not passed, what have to be done to get
  it approved?
